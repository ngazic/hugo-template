# Admin

This is the configuration folder for [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/). You can configure the folders and fields in `config.yml` and add custom editor components in `admin.html`.

## local development

You can run the CMS locally by running

`npx netlify-cms-proxy-server`

Make sure that `local_backend: true` is in `config.yml`.
